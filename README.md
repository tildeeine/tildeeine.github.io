# Personal Homepage

This is a personal homepage project created to practice web development and showcase both technical and personal projects. It serves as a portfolio to display the work I've done throughout my years at university, as well as other projects.

## Tech Stack

- **Next.js**: A React framework for building fast and user-friendly web applications.
- **TypeScript**: A superset of JavaScript that adds static types.
- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **TailwindCSS**: For styling the components.

## Getting Started

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

### Installation

First, clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tildeeine/tildeeine.github.io.git
cd tildeeine.github.io
``` 

Then, install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
# or
pnpm install
# or
bun install
```
### Running the development server
First, run the development server:

```sh
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev

```

Open http://localhost:3000 with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying **app/page.tsx**. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses **next/font** to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
