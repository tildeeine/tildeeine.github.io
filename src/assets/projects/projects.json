On dangerous readings, the option to activate a kill switch for the oven appears, which allows the user to remotely turn off the oven. This feature can be used by the resident of the house, or by caretakers who would also have access to the platform to monitor the resident's safety. \n\nThe system is designed to be user-friendly and accessible, with a simple and intuitive interface that provides clear information and control options. The system is also designed to be scalable, allowing for additional sensors and appliances to be added in the future to further enhance safety and monitoring capabilities.",

Implemented digital signatures for data integrity and authenticity, as well as an authentication server handling access, ensuring that patient data is not tampered with and that only authorized users can access it. \n\nThe system is designed to be scalable and secure, with a focus on protecting patient data and ensuring that only authorized users can access it. It also supports an emergency override option available to physicians, but will be alerted to the patient if used. The use of digital signatures and encryption ensures that patient data is protected from unauthorized access and tampering, while the use of firewalls and authentication mechanisms helps to prevent unauthorized access to the system. The system is designed to be user-friendly and accessible, and users interact with it through a simple CLI",

I spent months preparing, testing my gear, and training to carry a heavy backpack. I planned all my food in advance and sent it to myself as depots along the way. My backpack weighed between 15kg to 30kg, depending on access to water and how far it was between depots.  \n\nI handled everything from setting up camp daily to navigating with sometimes outdated maps. I faced challenges like Achilles tendonitis in the first week, a malfunctioning burner in the middle of the mountains the second week, and all sorts of weather. I learned to deal with unexpected issues creatively, and the experience boosted my skills in planning, persistence, and problem-solving.",
