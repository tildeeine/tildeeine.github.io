In addition to developing the application, we had to write tests to prove the liveness, validity, and security features of the system. \n\nWe worked in groups of three, where I was mainly responsible for the client side of the transactions as well as testing. During testing I wrote code to simulate different attacks, such as replay, double spending and Byzantine node collaboration attacks. I also implemented digital signature-based authenticaiton to ensure integrity and authenticity of all messages in the system. \n\n In the end, we were able to achieve almost all requested functionality, and received an 18/20 grade, equivalent to an A.",

The goal of the system was to allow these individuals to live at home longer instead of moving to a care home. \n\nOur system monitors potentially hazardous ome appliances using Raspberry Pi, Arduino and Nicla Vision. For the prototype, we created a web dashboard using React for frontend and flask to communicate with APIs hosted at the RPIs. The system offers information about the current oven temperature and when the door was last opened, as well as surveillance images from the Nicla Vision. \n\nThe prototype is very simple, but it was fun to handle the challenge of communicating with multiple components and tinkering with the hardware necessary to get the heat and door sensors, and the Nicla Vision camera to work. We use WiFi to communicate with IoT-devices running python and C++ code.",

My main motivation was to challenge myself and go outside my comfort sone in terms of distance, backpack weight, and confidence. \n\nI began training and planning already in October of 2020, and followed a structured plan to slowly work up to the weight of the backpack and the daily distance. I also had to manage logistics around food, water, supplies and gear for the full distance, as well as navigation and route planning. The months leading up to the hike were used to test my gear on smaller hikes and training. \n\nI started the hike right after the exam period in June, and spent 32 days on the trail, including 5 rest days. I planned all food in advance, and sent it to myself to pick up at post offices along the way. My backpack weight was up to 35 kg at the heaviest when it was long between resupplies and access to water. I hiked solo and had to tackle all challenges that arose on my own, including daily tasks, navigation, as well as injuries, gear failures, and weather conditions. I learned a lot about planning, persistence, and problem-solving, and the experience was a great confidence boost.",
